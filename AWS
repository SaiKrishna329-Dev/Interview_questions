     create IAM role in account B to access S3 and in that role's trust policy add the account A ID --> copy the role ARN (arn:aws:iam::<AccountB_ID>:role/CrossAccountS3AccessRole) --> attach the IAM policy to the app's IAM role/user as AssumeRole in account B --> run "aws sts assume-role \
  --role-arn arn:aws:iam::<AccountB_ID>:role/CrossAccountS3AccessRole \
  --role-session-name AppAccessS3" gives temporary creds as accesskey, secretkey and secure token, we can use these creds to access but better sol to use AWS SDK for this task like python code.
